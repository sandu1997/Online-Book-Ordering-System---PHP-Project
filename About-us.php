        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <img src="bg-images\reading.jpg" width=300px height=200px class="center">
        <br>
        <p>Our business venture started in 1959 in a very modest scale has now grown to be the leading book publishing home in Sri Lanka. This achievement has been made possible due to the indomitable courage, perseverance and enterprising commitment of our founder and joint managing director Deshabandu Sirisumana Godage. Born in a remote village in the backwoods of the Matara district in the South of Sri Lanka Deshabandu Sirisumana Godage migrated to the capital City – Colombo after completing his primary and post primary education in the village school.

        Thereafter he apprenticed in type setting, book binding and composing. After becoming a master book binder he started publishing and selling books in a small 10’x 6’ room rented by him. His business prospered and he was able to reach the zenith in the book publishing and selling trade in Sri Lanka within a short period.

        Mr. Sirisunama Godage has been conferred the honorary title ‘Deshabandu’ (Kindred to the Nation ) by the state in recognition of his colossal service towards the field of book publishing and literature. He has also bagged the annual state literary award for book publishing continuously for 20 years since 1986.</p>
